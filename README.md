# Express Starter Template with TypeScript

This template is crafted to provide a strong foundation for building backend applications using Express and TypeScript. It brings together the simplicity and flexibility of Express with the robustness and safety of TypeScript, setting you up for a productive development experience.

## Features:

- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js that's fast and lightweight.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **ts-node-dev**: A tool that restarts your TypeScript app when code changes.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: `gh repo clone ozergklp/express-typescript`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npx ts-node-dev src/index.ts`
4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: `npm run build`

Adjust this template as needed for your project. Happy coding!
